About

This is a Machine Learning Intrusion Detection model and front end created for my Final Year Project.
It uses the CICIDS-2018 Dataset for training

At this current moment it has issues with overfitting to the training data and can not correctly identify many types of attacks on a network this can be easily fixed by retraining the model with modified varibles for better outcomes in testing
